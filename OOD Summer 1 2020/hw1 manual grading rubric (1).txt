 -1 pt (total): variable names that do not accurately represent what it stands for (limit only to parameter names and instance variables, not local variables)
 
 -1 pts (each, total up to -4): each instance variable that is not private in Webpage class 
 
 -2 pts (each, total up to -4): missing any comments for what a public method is supposed to be doing.  (It is ok to not comment an implementation if the interface has good comments)
 
 -2 pts (each, total up to -4): comment is present, but not informative about what the method is doing (e.g. a test method that expects an exception, but does not say what it is looking for)
 
 -2 pt (total): code that is convoluted without a good reason. Examples are: case statements smartly arranged to avoid breaks for each, conditions that are more complicated than they need to be.
 
 Do not take points off if it uses ifs rather than switch, but leave a 0 point warning.
 
 -1 pt (each, total up to -3): instance variables that are not initialized anywhere (-0 pt warning if they are initialized at the time of declaration instead of constructor)
 
 -1 pt (each, total up to -3): unwanted uncommented print statements, even if used for debugging
 
 -5 pts: the Duration interface was changed in any fashion
