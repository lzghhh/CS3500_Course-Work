Program behavior: 30 points (individual deductions -- use all that apply)
(Recommended: test with toh-3 which is reasonably sized)
    -5 one or more functions not obvious from UI (explanation in a menu item/button are OK. Having to read code/README: not OK)
    -5 program does not play animation

    -2 no way to change speed
    -1 Speed change is not effective immediately
    -2 no way to pause and resume
    -2 no way to loop back
    -2 enabling/disabling looping requires program restart
    -2 no way to restart animation (in non-loop mode)
    -4 no way to add shapes
    -2 adding shapes with duplicate names isn't prevented
    -4 no way to delete shapes
    -4 no way to add keyframes
    -2 no way to add keyframes before first-existing or after
       last-existing keyframe
    -2 inserted keyframe isn't interpolated as expected
    -4 no way to delete keyframes

//Testing: 10 points (individual deductions -- use all that apply)
//    -3 No JUnit tests for any handler/listener
//    -2 No JUnit tests for controller
//    -5 Tests missing for earlier parts of the project
----
Design: 7 points (individual deductions -- use all that apply)
    -4 controller does not hold references to model and view. View holds reference to controller or model
    -3 control does not come to controller upon key or mouse press or
       other UI interaction (NOTE: the view can handle low-level key
       or mouse events, if it then raises higher-level events that the
       controller *can* listen to)
    -1 the view exposes events only as String messages, or some other
       low-level event, rather than something better suited for this
       specific project

Commenting: 8 points
